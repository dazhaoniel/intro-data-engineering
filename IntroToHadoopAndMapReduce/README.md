Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce
=============================

This folder contains code for [Udacity's Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud617) Final Project and also for the Fantastic/Fantastically exercise from Lesson 4 which I found challenging.

#### Final Project

The raw data for this project is available [here](http://content.udacity-data.com/course/hadoop/forum_data.tar.gz).

And [here](https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud617/local-testing-instructions/) are instructions for local testing with a smaller dataset.

#### Lesson 4: Inverted Index (Fantastic/Fantastically)

Lesson 4 uses the same dataset as the final project. The [Inverted Index exercise](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud617/lessons/713848763/concepts/7111190830923) asked us to write a MapReduce program that creates an index of all words in the "body" of the forum_node.tsv file. The quiz questions specifically asked for the occurrence of the word "fantastic" and "fantastically".
